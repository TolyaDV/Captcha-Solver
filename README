My First CAPTCHA-Solving Library
This is my very first library for solving various types of CAPTCHAs using third-party services.

Capsolver Class
The Capsolver class solves CAPTCHAs through the Capsolver service. Currently, only Cloudflare CAPTCHA solving is implemented â€” more types will be supported in the future.

Getting Started
To use CAPTCHA solving, you need to obtain an API key from the CAPTCHA-solving service we will be using.

Next, set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
